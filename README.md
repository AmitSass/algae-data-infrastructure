# Algae Data Infrastructure Project

This repository presents a comprehensive Data Engineering and Analytics project implemented at **BarAlgae**, a leading microalgae cultivation company. The goal was to build a robust, scalable data platform integrating diverse data sources to enable advanced analytics and predictive modeling for improved operational decisions.

## ðŸš© Project Overview

The project included building an automated data pipeline, cloud-based storage and data warehousing solutions, analytics dashboards, and machine learning models. It enabled real-time monitoring, efficient management, and predictive insights for algae cultivation.

## ðŸ”— Main Components

### 1. Data Ingestion & Pipeline Automation
- Automated daily ingestion from multiple sources:
  - Excel files and Google Sheets.
  - Internal SQL databases.
  - Real-time sensor data and various operational machinery.
- Orchestration of data pipelines using Apache Airflow.

### 2. Data Lake and Warehouse
- Centralized storage in an AWS S3 Data Lake, organized with partitions for optimized access.
- Data Warehouse created in AWS Redshift:
  - Structured layers (Staging, Intermediate, Marts).
  - Automated daily ETL transformations using DBT.

### 3. Dashboards and Visualizations
- Power BI dashboards for operational tracking and management:
  - KPI tracking.
  - Predictive analytics (harvest times, algae density, health indicators).
  - Daily refreshed, interactive reports.

### 4. Machine Learning Models
- Predictive models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting):
  - Predict algae density and optimal harvesting time.
  - Achieved high accuracy (RÂ² > 0.8).
  - Models fully integrated into the daily analytics platform.

### 5. AI-Based Chatbot
- Developed a chatbot powered by AI (Claude AI).
- Enabled users to query data naturally and obtain immediate insights.
