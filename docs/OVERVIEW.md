# Project Overview

## ðŸš© Business Context

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive Data Engineering and Analytics project implemented at **BarAlgae**, a leading microalgae cultivation company. The goal was to build a robust, scalable data platform integrating diverse data sources to enable advanced analytics and predictive modeling for improved operational decisions.

## ðŸ”— Main Components

### 1. Data Ingestion & Pipeline Automation
- **Automated daily ingestion** from multiple sources:
  - Excel files and Google Sheets
  - Internal SQL databases  
  - Real-time sensor data and various operational machinery
- **Orchestration** of data pipelines using Apache Airflow

### 2. Data Lake and Warehouse
- **Centralized storage** in an AWS S3 Data Lake, organized with partitions for optimized access
- **Data Warehouse** created in AWS Redshift:
  - Structured layers (Staging, Intermediate, Marts)
  - Automated daily ETL transformations using DBT

### 3. Dashboards and Visualizations
- **Power BI dashboards** for operational tracking and management:
  - KPI tracking
  - Predictive analytics (harvest times, algae density, health indicators)
  - Daily refreshed, interactive reports

### 4. Machine Learning Models
- **Predictive models** (Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting):
  - Predict algae density and optimal harvesting time
  - Achieved high accuracy (RÂ² > 0.8)
  - Models fully integrated into the daily analytics platform

### 5. AI-Based Chatbot
- **Developed a chatbot** powered by AI (Claude AI)
- **Enabled users** to query data naturally and obtain immediate insights

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Cloud**: AWS (S3, Redshift)
- **ETL/ELT**: Apache Airflow, DBT
- **Analytics and Visualization**: Power BI
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## ðŸ“Š Business Impact

- **25% improvement** in operational efficiency
- **30% reduction** in harvest timing errors
- **20% cost savings** through optimized resource usage
- **Real-time visibility** into cultivation processes
- **AI-powered insights** for data-driven decisions

## ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy

This repository contains **synthetic data only**. No production endpoints, schemas, metrics, or secrets are included. The demo showcases the technical architecture and patterns without exposing proprietary business logic or sensitive information.

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo vs Production

| Aspect | Demo (This Repo) | Production |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **Data** | Synthetic samples | Real production data |
| **Storage** | MinIO (local) | AWS S3 |
| **Warehouse** | PostgreSQL | AWS Redshift |
| **Orchestration** | Airflow examples | Airflow on ECS |
| **Secrets** | .env file | AWS Secrets Manager |
| **Scale** | Small datasets | Millions of records |
